# Initial Project Ideas and Proposals

--------

* **Kevin Sandoval - Project Idea: 

HAGO- the decentralized Amazon for artistic assets.

* **Nordo Nissi - Project Idea:  

The use of blockchain to ease voter registration and validate voter rolls.

* **Andy Singleton  - Project Idea: SAFT Replacement Security**

The SAFT concept for funding pre-ICO development is flawed, and law firms which originally promoted SAFT have fired their ICO team and clients.  This has created an urgent a ""legal or business problem"" for both past SAFT issuers that have not converted, and the approximately 800 companies that are currently selling or preparing to sell SAFTs.  This workshop will design a longer-lived equity security to replace SAFT, in which tokens can be received as a dividend rather than as a conversion, and in which many more adaptations can be handled in the life of the security. We will also design a purchase and subscription agreement that allows this instrument to be traded as a blockchain token in international private exempt markets. And, we will design code that can be included in the security to allow the replacement and editing of the token transfer record, given the cooperation and signature of an arbitrator.

I would also propose a more code-focused track to just work on the arbitration of changes to the token record. In a typical cryptocurrency offering, from 5% to 40% of the tokens are lost to scammers, bugs, and lost keys, either initially or over time. This is unacceptable for a company that is issuing securities. For example, if a company issues securities to someone who then does without leaving a key, the securities are still owed to the heirs.  In this case, we will need a way cancel and replace the lost  tokens. This goes a long way to solving the problem of keeping safe and inexpensive custody of crypto assets, which is very difficult with non-repudiatable crypto transactions."

* **Sean Smith - Project Idea: Prenuptial Agreements on the Blockchain a.k.a. "The Ball and Chain"**

The Ball and Chain concept is a web application that reduces the awkwardness, friction and cost of obtaining a prenuptial agreement.   The web application would ask a series of questions to each soon-to-be spouse and form a digital prenuptial agreement, obtain a notarized-digital-signature via a remote notary then hash the contents of the agreement and add it as a block on the blockchain.  In the event of a divorce the couple is then able to start their separation, guided by the enforceable and legal prenuptial agreement they signed.  As of last year 2 M marriages occurred,  with 3%-4% obtaining a prenuptial agreement that costs typically between 5k-10k.  With 50% of marriages ending in divorce there is an opportunity to lower the barrier to entry for prenuptial agreements and reduce legal cost.  This model can then be applied to other types of contracts e.g. wills and employment agreements.  This would fall under the Smart Contracts Legal Challenge for CL+B Fest Global Challenges.

* **Matthew Kirincic - Project Ideas:**

**1 Project Name: We The Customers**

Description:
This project will focus on improving the outdated legislative and electoral processes in the U.S. Congress by exploring ways to implement blockchain voting tools, smart contracts and other new technologies that could foster a more open and transparent government. Changing times and emerging paradigms may soon demand a more dynamic and responsive legislative body, but also one that adheres to the core principles of the U.S. Constitution. 

Our goal is to find a set of solutions that could add an extra ""layer"" to the policymaking process, where citizens can directly contribute to legislative agenda setting, policy drafting and creation.

We are not committed to any particular methods yet, but some combination of open source policy development (modeled off GitHub), crowd sourced Congressional agenda setting (upvote bills to the floor), liquid democracy, blockchain opinion polling, legislation written into smart contracts, and more, could be useful in implementing principles of direct democracy. 

2. I believe this proposal would best address the Zen Governance Challenge and would be eager to develop the project around its design specifications.

* **Ezra Tollett - Project Idea: Loot**

Loot is a browser plugin that allows users to capture and sell their data trail in a business marketplace.

--------

* **Daria Siganova - Project Idea: Biological Identity**

Description: Digital medical card that will track individual's medical history and doctor transactions. With a twist. It will be able to access and store data from various wearable tracking devices (Fitbit, Apple Watch) and discover mythologies, illnesses, pre-existing or new conditions. The data can be accessed by doctors with the proposal for illness to ensure a more effective treatment. Implications - legal implications in terms of access to person's biological data, societal/economic - need for doctors if eventually the condition can be analyzed by the A.I. and the diagnosis given without human interference.

* **Donaldy Salvant - Project Idea: "VibeChain"**

Our project is called "VibeChain", a musical shared playlist  that use a Smart Prioritization algorithm to play attendees favorite songs. Others can send you tokens if they enjoy the song or if they like the way you move/dance while your song is playing.

--------

* **Michael McCarthy and Hanbin - Project Idea: Refugee ID**

ID refugees to leave camps sooner + compliant global payment system for cross border employment  

--------

* **Bob Craig - Project Idea: Engage in Sovereign Identity Hacks**

--------

* **Alex - Project Idea: Unique identity enforcement**

Develop a system for ensuring that each participant in a network represents a unique individual (i.e. no sybils).  I'm not even sure to what extent such an identity system can be decentralized.  Bitcoin gets around this issue by using proof of work.

As described in the Sovereign Legal Identity challenge, it's certainly useful to be able to prove that you are the person behind a particular identity, but there are plenty of interesting use cases for such identities to be unique per person."
