The SAFT concept for funding pre-ICO development is flawed, and law firms which originally promoted SAFT have fired their ICO team and clients.  This has created an urgent a &quot;legal or business problem&quot; for both past SAFT issuers that have not converted, and the approximately 800 companies that are currently selling or preparing to sell SAFTs.  This workshop will design a longer-lived equity security to replace SAFT, in which tokens can be received as a dividend rather than as a conversion, and in which many more adaptations can be handled in the life of the security. We will also design a purchase and subscription agreement that allows this instrument to be traded as a blockchain token in international private exempt markets. And, we will design code that can be included in the security to allow the replacement and editing of the token transfer record, given the cooperation and signature of an arbitrator.<br><br>I would also propose a more code-focused track to just work on the arbitration of changes to the token record. In a typical cryptocurrency offering, from 5% to 40% of the tokens are lost to scammers, bugs, and lost keys, either initially or over time. This is unacceptable for a company that is issuing securities. For example, if a company issues securities to someone who then does without leaving a key, the securities are still owed to the heirs.  In this case, we will need a way cancel and replace the lost  tokens. This goes a long way to solving the problem of keeping safe and inexpensive custody of crypto assets, which is very difficult with non-repudiatable crypto transactions.</td></tr><tr style='height:20px;'><th id="63313692R4" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px;">5</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Sean Smith</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Prenuptial Agreements on the Blockchain a.k.a. &quot;The Ball and Chain&quot;.  The Ball and Chain concept is a web application that reduces the awkwardness, friction and cost of obtaining a prenuptial agreement.   The web application would ask a series of questions to each soon-to-be spouse and form a digital prenuptial agreement, obtain a notarized-digital-signature via a remote notary then hash the contents of the agreement and add it as a block on the blockchain.  In the event of a divorce the couple is then able to start their separation, guided by the enforceable and legal prenuptial agreement they signed.  As of last year 2 M marriages occurred,  with 3%-4% obtaining a prenuptial agreement that costs typically between 5k-10k.  With 50% of marriages ending in divorce there is an opportunity to lower the barrier to entry for prenuptial agreements and reduce legal cost.  This model can then be applied to other types of contracts e.g. wills and employment agreements.  This would fall under the Smart Contracts Legal Challenge for CL+B Fest Global Challenges.</td></tr><tr style='height:20px;'><th id="63313692R5" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px;">6</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">Matthew Kirincic</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1.
