# Hack Track 

**Hack the Law With Us**

The Boston Node's "Hack Track" will be held at Cambridge Innovation Center: 1 Broadway (5th Floor Venture Cafe Space), Cambridge MA 02142.  The CL+B Fest Hack Track provides simple ways for participants to propose relevant projects of any kind relevant to the themes of the CL+B Fest event.  In addition, any team may choose to do a project that competes for an organized general CL+B Fest "Challenge".  To learn about the several challenges, see: [http://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018-hack/](http://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018-hack/)

Doors will open for participants in the Hack Track at 11:00 AM on Saturday, March 17th.
