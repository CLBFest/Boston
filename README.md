# Come Hack the Law With Us

The Boston Node's "Hack Track" will be conducted in partnership with the MIT Bitcoin Expo Hackathon event, which is also happening this weekend.  The CL+B Fest Hack Track provides simple ways for participants to propose relevant projects of any kind relevant to the themes of the CL+B Fest event.  In addition, any team may choose to do a project that competes for an organized general CL+B Fest "Challenge".  To learn about the several challenges, see: [http://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018-hack/](http://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018-hack/)
